lat,F,Yes,-,"Latitude, in decimal degrees, south is negative."
lon,F,Yes,-,"Longitude, in decimal degrees, west is negative."
usehorizon,I,No,1,"Calculate taking into account shadows from high horizon. Value of 1 for ""yes""."
userhorizon,L,No,-,"Height of the horizon at equidistant directions around the point of interest, in degrees. Starting at north and moving clockwise. The series '0,10,20,30,40,15,25,5' would mean the horizon height is 0° due north, 10° for north-east, 20° for east, 30° for south-east, etc."
raddatabase,T,No,"default DB","Name of the radiation database (DB): ""PVGIS-SARAH"" for Europe, Africa and Asia or ""PVGIS-NSRDB"" for the Americas between 60°N and 20°S, ""PVGIS-ERA5"" and ""PVGIS-COSMO"" for Europe (including high-latitudes), and ""PVGIS-CMSAF"" for Europe and Africa (will be deprecated). The default DBs are PVGIS-SARAH, PVGIS-NSRDB and PVGIS-ERA5 based on the chosen location (see Figure xx)."
month,T,Yes,-,"The value of this parameter should be the number of the month, starting at 1 for January. If you give the value 0 (zero) you will instead get data for all the months."

aspect,F,No,0,"Orientation (azimuth) angle of the (fixed) PV system, 0=south, 90=west, -90=east."
global,I,No,0,"Output the global, direct and diffuse in-plane irradiances. Value of 1 for ""yes"". All other values (or no value) mean ""no""."
glob_2axis,I,No,0,"Output the global, direct and diffuse two-axis tracking irradiances. Value of 1 for ""yes"". All other values (or no value) mean ""no""."
